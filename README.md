# react-portfolio

Portfolio site built using React.js, Node.js, and JavaScript. Project styled with bootstrap and the react-spring animation library.

Project started with a Youtube tutorial, but by the end I was adding several features on my own.
  - browserRouter to hashRouter migration
  - Sticky footer
  - Second image carousel
  - _blank external link routing
