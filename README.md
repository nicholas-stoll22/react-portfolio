# react-portfolio

portfolio site built using react, node, and javascript. styled with bootstrap and the react-spring animation library.

followed a youtube tutorial for the bones, but went out on my own as it progressed began adding new feeatures/updating things that didn't work (added a second carousel, migrated browserRouter to hashRouter to work on GitHub, created sticky footer, etc).
